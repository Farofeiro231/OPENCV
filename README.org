* Overview
This repository's goal is to hold my work for the Digital Image Processig course at UFRN. The programs here contained are of escalating complexity, starting with simple pixel manipulations in an image, going through video file manipulations until image frequency filtering.
* Pixel and region manipulation
Within the *pixel-manipulation* folder, there are a few simple programs. The first program (/pixels.cpp/) is a simple region manipulation one, where a strip of the image is painted in orange. The operation there performed is shown below. It works simply by opening an image file, determining a rectangular region to be written to and looping through its pixels to change their color one by one. I could certainly do this in a smarter and faster way, but the intent of the exercise was to make us used to working and manipulating pixels.

The /pixel-manip.cpp/ only opens the image passed as an argument and converts it to a grayscale image, hence I won't discuss it any further. The /regions.cpp/ program, however, is a bit more interesting; in it, the user passes an image image during the function call for the program to "negate" one portion of it; it works as follows: once the image is open, the user is asked for two (x, y) points, one for the upper-left corner of the negative rectangle to be created, and the other for the bottom-right corner. Once the two points are provided, every pixel within that zone has its value replace by the corresponding negative value; i.e.:
